    #Wow, that is a weird one,
    #here is the rruff.ima formula: FeS·≈0.85[Fe(OH)2]
    #here is the mindat formula: Fe2+6(Fe2+,Mg)5S6(OH)10
    #here is the formula from the original paper: 6FeS · 5Fe(OH)2
    #
    #For some reason they don’t want to use more parentheses in these formulas, but based on the formula comparisons this should be:
    #[Fe^2+^S^2-^]_6_·[Fe^2+^(OH)_2_]_5_
    # 
    #The rruff.ima formula is almost correct, but 0.85 should be replaced with 0.83333333 (0.833333 = 5/6).
